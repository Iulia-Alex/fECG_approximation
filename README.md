# ECG Time-Reversal Inference Tool

This project provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for doing the inference process on new generated ECG files and returning Fetal Heart Rate value. The interface allows the user to select an ECG recording, a channel, and a phase needed to perform time-reversal and inference using pre-trained models.

## Usage

Run the `frontend.py` script to launch the GUI:

```bash
python frontend.py
